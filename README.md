# Ptakoinformator

A mobile application (Android only) for the classification of 375 birds species 
based on photos from [this kaggle database](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species).

Created with the use of EfficientNet-Lite0 neural network from TensorFlowLite.

All the classification data is stored locally in Room database on end device.

Script for training the network (in Python 3.8+) is also included [in this repo](/training/) and is not required for app to build.
